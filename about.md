## TL;DR

> I work at the intersection of engineering, documentation, and learning systems, turning tacit technical knowledge into clear, durable systems others can understand, use, and build on.

Hi, I’m Marilyn. I source, synthesize, and document information.

I work at the intersection of engineering, documentation, and teaching and learning systems. I build bridges by translating technical complexity into general understanding, and by turning what’s built, tacit, or assumed into readily available knowledge others can leverage.

## The Drive
I’m a lifelong learner with a deep curiosity - I want to know something about anything and everything. I'm intrigued by the smallest everyday things and how they fit into the grand scheme of things. What lights up my brain is recognizing patterns across domains and making sense of seemingly unrelated ideas. I'm not satisfied with just knowing the facts; I want to understand the gaps, the connections, the _why_ behind the _what_.

This drive is why I’ve often been the go-to person to explain concepts, regardless of whether I knew the subject matter beforehand. It was never about what I already knew, but about what I could figure out - identifying where misunderstanding crept in and resolving it, whether that meant bridging conceptual gaps, making dense material more accessible, or breaking overwhelming information into digestible pieces.

## The Practice
I've done this work across industries and contexts, including fintech, research, and education. Sometimes I create original knowledge transfer systems from scratch. Other times, I refine and document what others have built. Often, it's both: I mint systems where none exist, and I make existing work visible, comprehensible, and maintainable.

With dual bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Interdisciplinary Studies (focused on engineering physics, statistics, and mathematics) and a people-centered approach, I operate at technical depth while creating the scaffolding that brings others along. 

In practice, this means I:
- Contextualize projects for technical and non-technical audiences including stakeholders, clients, end users, and anyone curious about what internal teams are building
- Document implicit knowledge from the processes, decisions, timelines, lessons learned, and solutions that often live in people's heads or informal channels/threads  
- Design systems for knowledge transfer, including frameworks, templates, documentation architectures, and organizational structures that outlive individual projects
- Support projects end-to-end, managing the full lifecycle, from requirements gathering and scope negotiation to risk mitigation, testing strategies, and handover documentation

## The Value
Good documentation creates institutional memory. It ensures that:
- Knowledge remains accessible even as people move on
- Onboarding time shrinks dramatically because information is explicit, not tribal
- Technical work becomes reusable and built on instead of reinventing solutions
- The scope and value of technical work are visible to non-technical stakeholders
- Frameworks and best practices propagate across projects

I believe technical excellence without communication is incomplete. The most elegant algorithm, the most rigorous research, or the most carefully designed system only matters if it can be understood, maintained, and built upon.

If you’re working on a tutorial, training manual, framework, or something complex that needs to be built, understood, maintained, or shared, let’s talk.
