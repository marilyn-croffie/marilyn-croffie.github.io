## TL;DR

> I bridge the gap between what’s built and what’s understood.
Whether it’s technical systems, research insights, or complex processes, I create documentation and frameworks that make knowledge accessible, reusable, and extensible.

## Hi, I’m Marilyn. 
I source, synthesize, and document information.

I work at the intersection of engineering, documentation, and learning systems. My role is often to stand between what’s being built and the people who need to understand, use, maintain, or extend it — and make that handoff actually work.

I translate technical complexity into shared understanding, and turn what’s assumed, scattered, or living in people’s heads into knowledge others can reliably build on.

## The Drive
I’m a lifelong learner with deep curiosity. I want to know how things work together.

What consistently pulls me in is pattern-finding across domains: noticing where ideas repeat, where systems break down, and where understanding gets lost between experts and everyone else. I’m not satisfied with knowing what works; I want to understand _why_, and _where_ that understanding tends to fail.

That’s why I’ve often been the person people turn to for explanations — even when the subject is new to me. The value I bring isn’t prior knowledge; it’s the ability to identify where confusion enters, and to resolve it by restructuring information, clarifying intent, and reducing cognitive friction.

## The Practice
I’ve done this work across education, research, and industry contexts.

Sometimes that means creating knowledge-transfer systems from scratch. Other times it means documenting and refining what already exists. Most often, it’s both: making existing work visible and understandable while designing structures that help it scale beyond the original creators.

With dual bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science and Interdisciplinary Studies (engineering physics, statistics, and mathematics), I work comfortably at technical depth — while keeping people, learners, and future contributors in view.

In practice, this looks like:
- Contextualizing technical work for both technical and non-technical audiences
- Capturing decisions, constraints, and lessons that usually live in people's heads or informal channels 
- Designing systems for knowledge transfer, including frameworks, templates, documentation architectures, and organizational structures that outlive individual projects
- Supporting work across its full lifecycle, from requirements and scope negotiation to testing strategies and handover documentation

## The Value
Good documentation creates institutional memory. 

It ensures that:
- Knowledge remains accessible even as people move on
- Onboarding time shrinks dramatically because information is explicit, not tribal
- Technical work becomes reusable instead of repeatedly reinvented
- The value of technical work is visible to non-technical stakeholders
- Practices and insights propagate across teams and projects

I believe technical excellence without communication is incomplete. A system only succeeds if people can understand it, maintain it, and build on it.

If you’re working on something complex that needs to be built, understood, sustained, or taught, [let's talk](/#cta-section).
