## The Context

Spring 2022. I was an undergraduate CS student in a project-based Computer Science program where students work in teams on industry-sponsored projects. During an end-of-semester feedback session, students raised concerns about team dynamics: communication breakdowns, unproductive feedback, assumptions about teammates' competence, and exclusionary group behaviors that undermined project success.

The program had a graduation outcome about "working successfully in diverse and inclusive environments," a skill industry partners consistently emphasized, but there were no structured learning experiences teaching us *how* to communicate professionally, recognize our own biases, address interpersonal conflicts, or create effective team environments.

I recognized the gap between industry expectations and our actual preparation. I decided to build the curriculum that should have existed.

## What I Built

I designed a theoretically grounded, pedagogically rigorous curriculum focused on professional collaboration skills. This became a 16-module program delivered across 4 semesters, backed by a 9-benchmark analytical framework grounded in cognitive psychology, experiential learning, and professional communication research. The work was eventually published as peer-reviewed research at ACM SIGDOC, a leading technical communication conference.

## The Framework: Nine Evaluative Benchmarks

Before writing curriculum content, I created evaluative criteria that interventions must satisfy to be pedagogically effective. These benchmarks synthesize principles from cognitive load theory, experiential learning, and workplace communication research:

**A. Evidence-Based Foundation** - Grounded in research on effective teamwork, communication, and professional development

**B. Expert-Informed** - Supported by scholarship in organizational psychology, technical communication, and engineering education

**C. Collaborative Learning Approach** - Promotes learning through team interaction and shared experience; creates psychologically safe learning environments

**D. Experiential Learning** - Incorporates concrete experience (activities), reflective observation (analysis), abstract conceptualization (frameworks), and active experimentation (application)

**E. Cognitive Load Management** - Reduces information overload through clear definitions, structured content, visual integration, and worked examples

**F. Resource Provision** - Connects students to support systems (counseling services, communication centers, professional development resources)

**G. Practical Implementation** - Deliverable within realistic time/space constraints; embedded in required coursework to signal importance

**H. Adaptable Design** - Modular structure allows content reuse, revision, and adaptation across different contexts

**I. Measurable Outcomes** - Enables evidence of learning aligned with professional competencies and program graduation outcomes

Every module had to satisfy all nine benchmarks, ensuring the curriculum was pedagogically sound, theoretically grounded, and practically implementable.

## The Curriculum: 16 Modules Across 4 Professional Competency Areas

The curriculum addresses critical gaps in how students develop professional collaboration skills. The 16 modules are organized into four competency areas:

**1. Decision-Making and Cognitive Awareness** - How mental shortcuts and biases influence professional judgment (pattern recognition bias, confirmation thinking, attribution errors, first impression effects)

**2. Professional Self-Awareness** - Understanding personal perspectives and their impact on team dynamics (recognizing differences in background and experience, self-reflection on assumptions, ethical responsibility in collaborative work)

**3. Interpersonal Effectiveness** - Building productive working relationships (creating inclusive team environments, recognizing subtle communication barriers, managing indirect conflict, understanding professional confidence challenges)

**4. Communication and Accessibility** - Ensuring clear, effective team communication (active listening across communication styles, empathy in professional contexts, constructive feedback delivery, accommodation and universal design)

Each module follows a three-week cycle: Week 1 introduces concepts with clear definitions, Week 2 engages students in case studies and team discussions, Week 3 provides reflection prompts and resources. This structure embeds experiential learning while managing cognitive load.

## Research Rigor: Analyzing Professional Communication Interventions

The published paper includes detailed analysis demonstrating how modules satisfy all nine benchmarks. For example, the module on subtle communication barriers (microaggressions) shows:

**Cognitive load management:** Content chunked into manageable sections, visual examples of communication patterns, worked scenarios demonstrating effective responses

**Experiential learning:** Students analyze realistic workplace scenarios, discuss patterns they've observed in team projects, reflect on their own communication habits

**Psychological safety:** Scenarios drawn from various sources (not requiring students to share personal negative experiences); discomfort normalized as part of professional growth

**Resource connection:** Links to communication centers, professional development workshops, team conflict resolution services

**Measurable outcomes:** Reflection assignments generate evidence of learning aligned with professional competency indicators

## The Impact: From Student Initiative to Institutional Infrastructure

What started as an undergraduate addressing a preparedness gap became permanent program infrastructure. The curriculum:

- **Became required coursework** embedded across four semesters
- **Served multiple cohorts** with a structure where returning students bring experience to discussions with new students
- **Addressed industry feedback** about graduates needing stronger teamwork and communication skills
- **Generated assessable evidence** through reflection assignments aligned with professional competency outcomes
- **Contributed to scholarship** through publication at ACM SIGDOC

I returned to the program as a graduate researcher and joined an interdisciplinary team (computer science, engineering, technical communication) to refine and research the curriculum. The ACM SIGDOC paper documents the design framework, analyzes implementation effectiveness, discusses challenges (distributed classroom limitations, accessibility improvements), and proposes refinements.

## Why This Matters for Workforce Readiness

Industry partners consistently emphasize that technical skills alone don't predict professional success. Engineers and computer scientists work on diverse teams, communicate across departments, navigate interpersonal dynamics, and make decisions under uncertainty. These professional competencies are learnable skills, not inherent traits.

The curriculum teaches students to:
- Recognize how cognitive biases affect technical decision-making and team collaboration
- Communicate effectively across different communication styles and backgrounds
- Give and receive professional feedback that improves work quality
- Create team environments where all members contribute effectively
- Navigate interpersonal challenges that arise in project work

By embedding these skills in project-based coursework—where students immediately apply them to real team challenges—the curriculum prepares graduates for the collaborative realities of professional technical work.

## What This Demonstrates

This project captures the full arc of building educational infrastructure:

**Identifying the gap:** Recognized that critical professional skills weren't being taught systematically

**Synthesizing knowledge:** Combined cognitive psychology, experiential learning, and professional communication research into a coherent framework

**Creating infrastructure:** Built 16 modules that could be delivered consistently across semesters and cohorts

**Ensuring quality:** Developed nine evaluative benchmarks that any intervention must satisfy

**Scaling beyond creators:** The curriculum outlived our direct involvement and became permanent program infrastructure

**Contributing to scholarship:** Published research that other institutions can adapt and build on

This work demonstrates my ability to:
- Identify when critical knowledge exists but isn't accessible or systematized
- Build frameworks that guide design and ensure quality
- Create modular, reusable educational infrastructure
- Ground practical interventions in theoretical principles
- Conduct and publish rigorous educational research
- Transform identified needs into institutional solutions

The curriculum model is portable to other project-based programs, demonstrating that essential professional collaboration skills can be taught systematically rather than assumed or hoped for.
