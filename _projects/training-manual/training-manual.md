## The Context

Spring 2020. The pandemic hit mid-semester. ME 203 had no assigned textbook for CMM operation. Students learned directly from the lab technician through curated lecture slides, demonstrations, and hands-on practice. When in-person lab access became uncertain, the course had no written resource students could reference independently.

The final project: create comprehensive documentation that would help future students learn CMM operation and GD&T measurement using PC-DMIS.

## The Challenge

I needed to create a training manual for a highly technical, hands-on skill without a source document to work from. The knowledge existed in three places:
1. **The technician's expertise** - years of practical knowledge, mostly tacit
2. **My own learning process** - what confused me, what clicked, what mistakes I made
3. **Scattered online resources** - PC-DMIS documentation, GD&T references, CMM operation guides

The manual needed to bridge theory (GD&T concepts), hardware (CMM operation), and software (PC-DMIS interface) in a way that textbooks and online resources treated separately.

## My Approach

**Knowledge synthesis from multiple sources:**

I built the manual by combining what I learned from three different channels. During lab sessions, I took detailed notes on the technician's demonstrations, paying attention not just to what buttons to press but *why* we pressed them and *when* things went wrong. I asked questions that revealed the decision-making logic behind procedures — what makes a good datum? Why does probe speed matter here but not there?

I mapped my own learning struggles to identify where explanations needed more depth. The points where I got confused became places where the manual needed clearer transitions or additional context. When I made mistakes, I documented both the error and the correction, which became the safety precautions embedded in the final manual.

I researched online to fill gaps the lab sessions couldn't cover: PC-DMIS dialog boxes I hadn't explored, GD&T standards I only partially understood, troubleshooting scenarios we hadn't encountered. Then I tested everything I wrote against actual CMM procedures to verify accuracy.

**Transforming demonstration into documentation:**

The technician could show us how to establish a datum, but translating that physical demonstration into written steps required capturing implicit knowledge: "Move slowly when you're near the surface" (why? to avoid deflection), "Always check that the green LED is off" (what happens if it's not?), "Press Done after all points are collected" (when exactly is that?).

I structured the manual around the same progression we followed in lab — basic setup, datum establishment, alignment, then increasingly complex measurements — because I knew that sequence worked for building conceptual understanding. But I added the explanatory layer that demonstrations can't provide: why this sequence matters, what each step accomplishes, how concepts connect.

**Design decisions:**

- **Safety without fear:** Embedded precautions at procedural steps rather than frontloading warnings, framing them as technique ("move slowly to ensure accurate readings") rather than prohibition
- **Progressive complexity:** Started with manual datum specification, built to true position tolerances under different material conditions
- **Dual-use structure:** Linear for learning, quick reference section for experienced users

## Technical Writing Challenges

**Challenge 1: Extracting tacit knowledge from an expert**

The technician knew CMM operation intuitively from years of muscle memory and pattern recognition. Getting that knowledge into explicit, teachable form required asking _why_ and _when_ constantly, even for steps that seemed obvious to an expert.

**Solution:** Attended every lab session I could, took detailed notes, and asked clarifying questions about edge cases and decision logic. Tested my written procedures against actual operation to catch unstated assumptions.

**Challenge 2: Maintaining technical precision without overwhelming learners**

The domain requires exact terminology (datum reference frames, cylindricity, RFS/MMC material conditions), but students, including me, were learning these concepts for the first time.

**Solution:** Defined terms at first use, maintained consistency throughout, and reinforced concepts through repeated application in different measurement contexts. Students learned by doing, not memorizing.

**Challenge 3: Managing cognitive load during multitasking**

CMM operation requires simultaneous attention to: the manual, the PC-DMIS screen, the hand controller, and the physical probe. Too much to track at once.

**Solution:** Broke procedures into small, discrete steps with clear transitions. Used callout boxes (Notes, Safety Precautions) as natural pause points where students could orient themselves before continuing.

## The Impact

The manual became the primary learning resource for ME 203 after I submitted it, serving multiple student cohorts. It enabled:

- **Independent learning** when lab access was limited or technician supervision wasn't available
- **Reduced equipment damage** from common beginner mistakes
- **Consistent instruction** across different lab sessions and semesters
- **Retained utility** as students kept it for reference in future coursework and industry work

What started as a final project became infrastructure — the permanent resource that replaced temporary, in-person instruction.

## What This Demonstrates

This project captures my core skill: **turning tacit technical knowledge into clear systems that last.**

The technician's expertise was valuable but lived in their head and in physical demonstrations. I extracted that knowledge, synthesized it with my own learning experience and external research, and created something that could outlive any single instructor or lab session. 

This is what I do: I source knowledge from wherever it lives (expert demonstrations, hands-on practice, fragmented online resources), synthesize it into coherent systems, and document it so others can learn, maintain, and build on it. The result is infrastructure that scales learning beyond individual interactions.
