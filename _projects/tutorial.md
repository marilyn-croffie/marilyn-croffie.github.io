## The Context
The 20-page CMM GD&T training manual I wrote for my metrology course showed me I could synthesize complex material into structured documentation that actually worked for learners.

A few months later, I enrolled in a beginner web development bootcamp that concluded with a technical writing competition. The timing mattered: I was new to Python, actively learning, and curious whether I could apply the same writing instincts to software concepts.

## The Challenge
The competition brief was simple: write a tutorial that could teach a Python concept, keyword arguments, clearly to beginners.

I teamed up with another participant. Python was new to both of us, but that became an advantage. We knew exactly where understanding broke down because we had just struggled through it ourselves. Every confusion point we encountered while learning became something we needed to explain.

## Our Approach
We centered the tutorial on exploration, letting learners experiment with interactive examples to see keyword arguments in action. Concepts were introduced step by step — from basic usage to defaults and mixed arguments, so learners could build understanding gradually. Every term was defined, and both correct usage and common errors were shown, giving learners a safe space to test, break, and truly understand the code. Nothing was assumed to be obvious, because it hadn’t been obvious to us.

## The Impact
We won the competition, and the tutorial was published on Educative.io shortly afterward. It went on to become one of the platform’s most-viewed Python articles in July 2022 and remained heavily used years later.

Following publication, I was invited to join Educative’s internal contributors team, where I reviewed and edited additional technical content. This project marked a clear shift in my work: from writing procedural guides to teaching conceptual reasoning through documentation.
