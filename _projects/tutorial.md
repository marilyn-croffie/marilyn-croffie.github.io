## The Catalyst: May 2020

Three months before this article was published, I'd written the CMM GD&T training manual for my metrology course. That 20-page manual—synthesizing tacit knowledge from a lab technician, my own learning struggles, and scattered online resources into structured educational material—showed me I had the chops for technical writing at scale. Not just editing friends' resumes and grad school statements (which I'd been doing for years), but creating comprehensive learning resources that worked.

When Our Girls Our Future (OGOF) announced a technical writing competition as the final project for their coding bootcamp, I was ready.

## The Context: Summer 2020

I was enrolled in OGOF's beginner web development cohort—my introduction to Python and web development. My programming background was scattered: C++ courses from my CS minor (taken sporadically when my mechanical engineering schedule allowed), and MATLAB programming for ME projects where I'd programmed EV robots. Those robot projects sparked my love of coding, but I hadn't built skills cohesively.

The bootcamp changed that. And the writing competition gave me a chance to prove what the CMM manual had revealed: I could learn technical concepts and immediately transform them into clear teaching material.

## The Challenge

The competition brief: Write a tutorial explaining a Python concept clearly enough that beginners could learn from it. Another participant and I teamed up to tackle keyword arguments.

We were writing as learners—Python was brand new to us. But that was an advantage. We knew exactly where understanding broke down because we'd just experienced it ourselves. Every confusion point we hit while learning became an explanation point in the tutorial.

## Our Approach

**Problem-first structure:** Why do keyword arguments exist? What pain do they solve? (Function calls with many parameters get confusing when you can't remember the order.)

**Progressive complexity:**
- Basic syntax: positional vs keyword arguments
- Mixing both types in one function call
- Default values and optional parameters  
- Common mistakes and their error messages

**Realistic examples:** Not `foo(x, y)` but actual use cases—configuration functions, API calls, utility methods where keyword arguments improve code clarity.

**Explicit about everything:** As beginners, nothing was "obvious" to us, so we couldn't rely on "this should be clear." We defined terms, showed order of operations, explained *why* syntax worked the way it did.

**Testing everything:** Every code example ran successfully. We deliberately introduced errors to show what `TypeError: func() got multiple values for argument 'x'` looks like—because beginners need to know what went wrong and how to fix it.

## The Impact

**End of Summer 2020:** We won the competition. The tutorial was published on Educative.io almost immediately—just three months after I'd written the CMM manual.

**The recognition opened doors.** Educative invited me to join their internal contributors team. I reviewed, edited, and wrote draft articles for publication, helping shape content quality across the platform.

**Two years later (July 2022), the tutorial was one of the platform's most-viewed articles.** It didn't just work for competition judges—it worked for thousands of learners encountering Python for the first time.

## The Turning Point: Fall 2021

A few months after the competition, I applied to the project-based CS program at my university. In my application, I committed to writing tutorials and documentation as my contribution to this new program. I meant it.

**Fall 2021:** I switched from CS minor to CS major, formalizing my commitment to this path.

**During the program, I delivered on that promise:**
- Created the **software lifecycle documentation suite** (test plans, database design docs, user guides, handover documentation) that's now used as templates and blueprints in the program
- Developed **training materials on inclusive and successful collaborative learning and working environments**, which later evolved into the comprehensive IDEA curriculum (published as research at ACM SIGDOC 2025)

As coursework intensified, I made the strategic decision to step back from Educative contributions to focus where I'd have the most impact: building documentation infrastructure that would outlive individual articles.

## What This Demonstrates

**Rapid synthesis:** Learned Python well enough to teach it within weeks of exposure

**Recognizing my throughline:** Years of editing friends' work → CMM manual (scale) → tutorial competition (validation) → contributor role (professionalization) → major switch (commitment) → documentation frameworks (institutionalization)

**Sustained impact:** A tutorial written in 2020 remained one of the most-viewed articles two years later. Good technical writing scales.

**Strategic career decisions:** Competition success → contributor experience → major switch → infrastructure building. Each step built deliberately on the previous.

**From contributor to architect:** Went from writing individual tutorials to designing documentation systems that others use. The progression: learn → teach → systematize.

## The Attribution Note

The published version on Educative.io lists an institutional author rather than individual contributors—common practice for educational platforms retaining publication rights. The evidence above confirms co-authorship, the competition win, publication timeline, sustained viewership metrics, and the internal contributor invitation.

**The throughline:** Years of editing taught me I could clarify ideas. The CMM manual showed I could do technical writing at scale. The tutorial competition validated I could learn fast and teach clearly. The contributor role professionalized those skills. The major switch formalized my commitment. And the documentation infrastructure I've built since—software lifecycle templates, training materials, and research-backed curricula—shows this became my core contribution: turning tacit knowledge into systems that last.
